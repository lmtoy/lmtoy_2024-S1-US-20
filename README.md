this project mosaics 4 fields, 800MHz , in galactic LB coordinates, for 3 sources

The OFF position seems to have CO has well.   12CO is strong, but 13CO well detected.

beam 13 is still bad.

baseline needs a patch from the default dv,dw

117355 had no roach data for the science source, The valid flag for this ObsNum is 0 which means it was aborted or failed to complete.

         Header.ScanFile.Valid = 0 ; 


G45.47  ok, but could use better VLSR to make it symmetric aroudn all emisson,
G30.76     could use better VLSR
G29.96
